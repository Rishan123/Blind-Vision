## Installing Tensorflow ##

Tensorflow is a machine learning framework which Google has provided. We will be using this in our project for the image classification. To install Tensorflow for Python 3:

```
sudo pip3 install tensorflow 
```
This installation will take a long time, so you might take a stroll in the park or have a cup of tea for a few minutes.


## Installing Google Text-To-Speech ##

Installing gTTS is free of cost and is really easy to install. Just use the single command on the Terminal:

### Python 2 ###
```
pip install gTTS
```

### Python 3 ###

```
pip3 install gTTS
```
