# Hardware #

These files are all about he elctronics such as the UDS, button and Pi Camera, etc. I have included a table of all the wirings in cas the finished product gets damaged or somebody else wants to make the same project too.

Component | Pin Number(s)
------------ | -------------
Button | 0V, GPIO 15
UDS | 0V, GPIO 17, GPIO 4, 5V

This is the diagram for the UDS wiring:
