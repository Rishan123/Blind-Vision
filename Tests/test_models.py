# Load the CIFAR10 dataset. CIFAR10 is a small dataset with only 10 classes. Strangely, when you train CIFAR10 with the

              # the fraction of the images that are correctly classified.

# Training the neural network requires the following steps:

# Feed the data into the model. It's like how you eat food, if you eat it and you like it, you start eating more.

# The model learns to associate images and labels.

# You ask the model to make predictions about a test setâ€”in this example, the test_images array. Verify that the
# predictions match the labels from the test_labels array.
